# setup-ocaml

#### Status: Discontinued

If you are reading this, that means you found a box hidden in a dusty attic. In
conclusion, since the project merged all the results of our experiments into
[ocaml/setup-ocaml](https://github.com/ocaml/setup-ocaml), the project
development was suspended and in May 2021 completely discontinued (Actually, it
was a little earlier.) If you are looking for a GitHub Action for the OCaml
programming language, visit
